# Small Assignments

Hey! This folder is basically my practice area – a bunch of smaller tasks and exercises I did while learning web development. Nothing too big here, just stuff that helped me get solid with the basics before jumping into larger projects like the iPod Marketplace.

### What's Inside
- **html_css_intro**: Early stuff where I practiced basic HTML structure and simple CSS styling – think semantic tags, basic layouts, and making things look decent.
- **css_interface_design**: Focused on building better user interfaces with CSS. Lots of work with Flexbox, Grid, positioning, and trying to make designs responsive and clean.
- **web_into_php_assignments**: My first steps into PHP – handling forms, basic server-side logic, including files, and generating dynamic content on pages.

There are also a couple of quick mock-ups (like static iPod and Sony Walkman marketplace pages) that I threw in here as I was experimenting with product layouts.

### What I've Mastered Here
Through these assignments, I really nailed down:
- Clean, semantic **HTML** markup
- Modern **CSS** techniques for layouts (Flexbox/Grid), responsive design, and styling components
- Core **PHP** basics: variables, loops, conditionals, form processing, includes/requires, and mixing PHP with HTML for dynamic pages
- Debugging small issues and making things work across browsers/devices

These little projects were super useful for building confidence and understanding how everything connects before tackling databases, logins, and full CRUD in my bigger apps.
