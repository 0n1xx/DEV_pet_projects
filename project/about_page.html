                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    At 2025 Sony Walkman Shop, we are dedicated to reviving the golden era of portable music, one Walkman at a time.
                    Our passion lies in celebrating and preserving the legacy of one of the most iconic inventions in audio history —
                    the Sony Walkman.
                </p>

                <h3>Our History</h3>

                <div class="timeline_block">
                    <h4>1979 – The Birth of the Walkman</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sony unveiled the first-ever portable cassette player: the Sony Walkman TPS-L2.
                        For the first time, people could carry music in their pockets, plug in headphones, and enter their own private soundscape.
                        It was more than a device — it was a cultural revolution.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline_block">
                    <h4>1980s–1990s – The Golden Era</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Walkman defined youth culture, music portability, and self-expression. From cassettes to CDs and MiniDiscs,
                        it adapted to the times while staying true to its essence: music, anywhere, anytime.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline_block">
                    <h4>2000s–2020s – Digital Takeover</h4>
                    <p>
                        As streaming and smartphones took over, physical media faded into the background.
                        But the charm, character, and physicality of the Walkman never truly disappeared.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline_block">
                    <h4>2025 – Rewind, Rediscover</h4>
                    <p>
                        In a fast, intangible digital world, a group of collectors and sound lovers in Toronto asked:
                        What if we brought the Walkman back — not just as a product, but as an experience?
                        We started in a small loft, surrounded by cassette tapes and curiosity. Word spread.
                        Musicians, tech fans, and nostalgic teens came together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We restored Walkmans, built relationships with former Sony engineers, sourced rare parts, and created custom designs.
                        Some devices came from Tokyo markets, others from Berlin attics. We gave each a second life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the 2025 Sony Walkman Shop is a global hub for analog audio lovers — a repair lab, a cultural space,
                        and a love letter to the past that still speaks to the future.
                    </p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    To keep the Walkman legacy alive by offering high-quality products, expert knowledge, and a vibrant community
                    for everyone who loves music — not just hearing it, but feeling it.
