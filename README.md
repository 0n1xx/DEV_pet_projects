# My Dev Pet Projects

Hey there! 👋 This is my little corner of personal projects where I've been building and experimenting with web stuff over the past year or so.

Everything here is built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP** – no frameworks, just vanilla code to really get comfortable with the fundamentals. I started with simple pages and gradually worked my way up to more complete apps with databases, logins, and admin areas.

### What I'm Using
- HTML5 & CSS3 (lots of Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- PHP for all the backend logic
- MySQL for storing data (with PDO and prepared statements)
- Sessions, file uploads, basic security stuff

### Projects

#### iPod Marketplace (my biggest and favorite project so far)
This one is a full online shop for vintage iPods – think product listings, detailed pages, and a complete admin dashboard.

What it has:
- Clean, responsive product grid and individual product pages
- Search and basic filtering
- Full admin panel where I can add/edit/delete products (proper CRUD)
- User registration and login system with sessions
- Multilingual support – switches between English and French
- Image uploads for products (with validation)
- Everything hooked up to a MySQL database securely

This project really pushed me. I learned how to organize code better (reusing headers/footers, helper files), handle file uploads safely, and build something that actually feels like a real web app.

#### Sony Walkman Marketplace
Similar idea to the iPod one, but smaller and built earlier. It's a product catalog for Sony Walkmans with nice cards and responsive design. Helped me practice layouts and get comfortable with displaying data from the database before tackling the bigger iPod project.

#### Small Assignments
Just a folder of smaller things I built along the way – form validations, little calculators, basic CRUD experiments, styling challenges. These were super helpful for practicing specific skills without the pressure of a big project.

### How I've Grown
I started out making static pages that looked okay on desktop but fell apart on mobile. Then I got better at responsive design, added JavaScript for interactivity, figured out PHP for dynamic content, and eventually tied it all together with a database and user system in the iPod project. Each step built on the last, and you can kind of see the progress as you look through the folders.

### Running the Projects Locally
