                    I speak of the devil, and he appears just to show he's listening
                    <br>
                    I've been looking for a god every day, it's a symptom of the system
                    <br>
                    Maybe it's 'cause I've been looking for a love, for a love, love I've never given
                    <br>
                    And you grew up a marigold, I cut the stem, an end to a beginning
